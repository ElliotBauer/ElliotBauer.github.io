This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to play the classic game in their web browsers.

## Project Structure

- **src/styles/style.css**: The stylesheet that defines the layout and appearance of the game.
- **src/scripts/app.js**: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic, including player moves and win conditions.

## How to Play

1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
2. Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) in an empty cell.
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
